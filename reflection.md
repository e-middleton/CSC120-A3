1. I worked with Ellie and Nicole
2. I went to office hours Sunday 1-3 and Monday 7-9, Sunday helped me figure out mirror words and Monday helped me figure out transcript indexing
3. My initial impressions are pretty much just that java right now feels similar to C++.
4. Different programs are good for different things, like, honestly once I figured it out I think I like java better for making classes/methods than python. But it was a bit of a pain in the butt to work out how to do things in Java the first time. 

5. What worked was doing things in super small chunks and running them to make sure I'm not leaving bugs for later. Another thing that was helpful was sleeping on my problems and coming back to them the next day. Also talking to other people to see what they were trying and why. Probably the most helpful thing for me this assignment was tracing out what was happening on paper, especially when things were going wrong it helped me see when I was overwriting a lot. Oh, and of course, PRINT STATEMENTS ARE MY FAV THING EVER. BEAUTIFUL MIRACLE WORKERS THEY ARE.
